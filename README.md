1) A (legal!) PDF of the book is at 

https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-6804-6

but you probably have to click that link from your low-side Supernet
(or whatever the La Jolla equivalent is) account for the download
to work. Hard copies are on Amazon, or your local CC* unclassified
library would order you one I am sure.

2) I haven't looked through this in great detail, but someone taught
a course out of this book at UC Davis in 2015. In particular, there
are worksheets and practice problems! This might be a good resource
as we go along. (ps - I downloaded her first two homeworks to this
repository)

3) Because I'm sure something, at some point, will confuse us ...
the errata is here.

4) A jointly created Latex file of problem solutions lives on Overleaf at

https://www.overleaf.com/9717958532hzfxsgkmqhcm#2e031e

Our default Overleaf limits the number of people who can share a project.
UCSB may have fixed it so we can all share; stay tuned for updates but 
meanwhile please let JRG know whether you can successfully edit in Overleaf.

5) I made a directory Problem-Writeups-and-Notebooks/ to collect .pdf's and .ipynb's (and so on) from all of us working on the problems. No .tex for now, hoping that can all live in Overleaf.

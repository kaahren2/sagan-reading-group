From Katie:

1) A (legal!) PDF of the book is at 

https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-6804-6

but you probably have to click that link from your low-side Supernet
(or whatever the La Jolla equivalent is) account for the download
to work. Hard copies are on Amazon, or your local CC* unclassified
library would order you one I am sure.

2) I haven't looked through this in great detail, but someone taught
a course out of this book at UC Davis in 2015. In particular, there
are worksheets and practice problems! This might be a good resource
as we go along.

3) Because I'm sure something, at some point, will confuse us ...
the errata is here.
